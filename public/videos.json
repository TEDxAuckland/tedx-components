The outdoors provides Sarah with perspective and vitality.\n\nShe kept a secret for 35 years from a traumatic event and broke her silence last years which led to a 9-month police investigation. The case was decided by the police that due to the lack of evidence it would not proceed to a court hearing. Sarah is confident that New Zealand systems and processes can be improved to make it gentler and safer for victims to share their secrets of historic abuse.\n\nSarah works in a business environment having held a number of senior leadership roles in the public sector and self-employment in the rehabilitation industry.

Once described as Springsteen via Fred Dagg, Witters’ performances draw from experiences such as hopping freight trains in the American Midwest, to being chased out of dive bars in the most northern parts of Scandinavia. All of which are tales that have aged this Gisborne-born crooner well beyond his years.

Home to the earliest inhabitants of New Zealand, Ihumātao is a landscape of cultural, historical, and environmental significance. Despite this, the Crown has failed to recognise its heritage values for New Zealand, allowing it to be sold for a proposed housing development. Realising that the plan meant 480 high-cost houses on the confiscated land, Pania and her cousins created the SOUL Campaign to resist the development. Later with family members and other supporters, she has occupied the land to protect it. Looking deeply into why Ihumātao has not been recognised as heritage worthy of protection in New Zealand, SOUL has uncovered the extent of the bias toward protecting colonial built heritage over sites of indigenous significance - an issue that is seen across the world. Here Pania tells the story of the fight to \\#ProtectIhumatao. From a childhood of struggle Pania never focused on the negative, but was fortunate to stay true to her Maoritanga. At nine years old she wrote in a time capsule that she wanted to be a lawyer to make a difference. After working hard to achieve that, she has temporarily left her law career to fulfill her purpose and responsibility to the environment for future generations.\n\nShe now dedicates her time to huis and the occupation of Ihumatao land. Everything she does is for others; her nieces and nephews, her whanau, and future generations, so the sacrifices are without regret. As a frontline protector of Ihumatao she has had to step out of her comfort zone and face challenges, all in the name of saving a unique and sacred land, contributing to a better Aotearoa for all.","images": [{"image":"/uploads/pania-newton_talk_1.jpg"}],"relatedPosts": null},

These studies have led to a potentially effective, affordable, and accessible treatment for many types of cancers. In this talk, Dr Tan discusses how this revolutionary treatment was discovered, and how it could change the future of cancer treatment for the world. [\\#cancerresearch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cancerresearch)\n\nFrom a family of 13 children brought up in a village in Malaysia, Dr Tan completed medical training at Melbourne University in 1985 and subsequently in New Zealand where he qualified as a plastic surgeon. Following fellowships at Oxford and Harvard he became Hutt Hospital’s Director of Plastic Surgery in 2000-2006 and Director of Surgery in 2007-2013.\n\nHe founded the Centre for the Study & Treatment of Vascular Birthmarks in 1996. Unsatisfied with the treatment for strawberry birthmarks he retrained as a scientist, receiving a PhD from Otago University in 2001. In 2013 he founded the Gillies McIndoe Research Institute, dedicated to relieving human suffering through paradigm-changing scientific research.\n\nDiscoveries by Dr Tan’s team of the stem cell origin of strawberry birthmarks underscore the new low-cost treatment of this tumour using anti-hypertensive medications. Building on this work, cancer stem cells, the proposed ‘root’ of cancer, have been discovered in 14 types of cancer, leading to a novel cancer treatment using low-cost commonly available medications. A clinical study is now underway for patients with glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer.\n\nDr Tan has received many honours and awards, is a holder of six patents and an author of over 150 publications.\n","images": [{"image":"/uploads/swee-tan-talk-1.jpg"}],"relatedPosts": null},

With an Honours degree in Zoology and Masters with distinction in Marine Science from Otago University, Riley ventured to South Africa to find his true passion - sharks. Being a surfer, free diver and spear-fisherman, Riley wanted to understand why sharks instilled so much fear in people and whether it was warranted. What he found was far worse – sharks are in rapid decline, receiving little sympathy due to their demonised stereotype.\n\nThrough the combination of high-tech science and stimulating visual imagery, Riley explains how conventional scientific communication can move at the speed of modern day media to achieve conservational goals. Riley is now utilising this form of communication to address international issues as the presenter of Shark Man TV.\n","images": [{"image":"/uploads/riley-elliott_talk_2.jpg"},{"image":"/uploads/riley-elliott_talk_1.jpg"}],"relatedPosts": null},

Instead, Chris Pemberton encourages you to focus on making the journey of life a colourful one and to create the mental space needed to open your mind to its infinite possibilities, as opposed to staying single-mindedly focus on one track. This way we can make sure all of the goals we are heading towards are in line with what drives us intrinsically. Chris believes the way to achieve this mindset is by exploring one's creativity. He shares his story of coming to this realisation, and the art projects he dived into that helped him discover the depths of his creative expression… and a psychedelic experience involving Ayahuasca. With an international experiment called Creative Mirror, Chris proves creativity exists in everyone, no matter their skill level. Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and opening up the art world.\n\nChris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”.\n","images": [{"image":"/uploads/chris-pemberton_talk_2.jpg"},{"image":"/uploads/chris-pemberton_talk_1.jpg"}],"relatedPosts": null},

And yet they’re being left off balance sheets and out of our conversations. Why is that?\n\nBefore you think that this talk isn’t for you, Paul has ninety-one trillion reasons for why it is. Because that’s the value of the global economy and virtually all of it, an estimated 90%, is based around intangible assets. Our cognitive biases and archaic accounting systems do not recognise the value of intangible assets, a value which - unlike the screen you’re watching this on - is poised to grow exponentially. So what exactly are intangible assets, and why do they matter to you, to accountants and to the economy? Let’s let Paul answer that.","images": [{"image":"/uploads/51329989344-6207ceee9f-o.jpg"}],"relatedPosts": null},
